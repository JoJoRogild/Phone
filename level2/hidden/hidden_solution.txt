opened in Hopper . 

The secret function is outside of the main: 

it does not get executed . so the solution is changing the execution to the address of the secret function.
in Hopper I tried to add assembly instructions to jump to it. surprise it did not work .
so I used GDB  and jumped there lol 

gdb hidden 

(gdb) jump secret
Continuing at 0x555555555149.
flag{3sc0nd1d0_3h_M41s_G0st0S0}

the flag is :  flag{3sc0nd1d0_3h_M41s_G0st0S0}

for once using gdb in terminal saved me .
