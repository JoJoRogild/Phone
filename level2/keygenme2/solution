Tools used 
GDB
radare2
ascii table

put break at main [break main]
type run
breaked at main
put breakpoint at *main+396
x/xg rbp-0xa0	= local_a0h
then this address = where key is 
x/sb <address> to see string output
put another break at main+404
then continue c
the address now has a string stored [this is your key]
type x/sb <address> key shows

i used python and used ansii table to compare 

user = input("enter username:")
for c in user :
	ord(c)
prints user into decimals
now what ever length your username is will be this 
user = input("enter username:")
enter username: cracked
>>>for c in user :
...	ord(C)+7  << notice the amount u add is the same as the length of the char
...
106 = j
121 = y
104 = h
106 = j
114 = r
108 = l
107 = k
>>> 
so what ever language you use it is char to int then add string length

[note]
First linux reverse
