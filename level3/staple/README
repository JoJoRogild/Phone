This crackme is linux only. It is compiled for 32 bit PC but
will run on 64 bit linux as well.

After extracting run the crackme without parameters:

  $ ./staple
  password: 

Then a prompt appears. Enter a password.
If the password is correct, you will be notified with

  correct password
  secret code: ****************

Where the secret code is the password for the
sourcecode.zip archive. If you get "correct password"
but not the secret code, your password was wrong (see below).

If the password is incorrect, the crackme will probably
tell you "incorrect password". Generally assume undefined
behaviour. 
It is possible that it will behave strangely
in case of wrong password (e.g. by not supplying a secret
code or getting stuck in an endless loop)
