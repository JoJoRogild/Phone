x86_64 linux binary (tested on debian 9 and ubuntu 18.04, should run on any distro). Takes one command line argument and outputs "OK!" if it's correct, "Wrong" if it's not.

Partially written in C, actual verification routine is assembly.

Don't patch the binary, of course - find the correct input.
